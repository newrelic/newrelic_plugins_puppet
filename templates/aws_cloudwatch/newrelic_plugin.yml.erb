  # Note: Overview dashboards are being deprecated
  #
  # An optional cloudwatch_delay attribute can be added for each agent
  # which adjusts the time window in seconds for CloudWatch querying.
  # Some of the Cloudwatch metrics are not immediately available and may
  # require a delay before being queried.
